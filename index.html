    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I recently completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration (BBA) with a passion for exploring the business world.
    After graduation, I gained valuable experience by working in sales for six months, 
    where I honed my communication and interpersonal skills.</p>
    <p>However, my curiosity and interest in technology led me to embark on a new journey. 
    I am currently studying web development as a beginner, eager to dive into the exciting world of coding, designing, and creating web applications. 
    Learning web development has been both challenging and rewarding, as I get to combine my creativity and problem-solving abilities to build interactive and user-friendly websites.</p>
